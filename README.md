# marshall-jordan-a2-digging-dog

Instructions:
Mouse left click makes the dog bark.
Using left click on the 'X' will let the dog dig and find the bone.

I couldn't quite figure out how to make it so that the dog can't go above the grass line. I would like to come back to it in the future once I figure that out.
